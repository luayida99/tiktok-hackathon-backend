# TikTok Hackathon Challenge 2023 Project Readme - FraudNow

Welcome to our Tiktok Hackathon Challenge 2023 project! Our chosen problem statement is on Reshaping Payments. 

This README provides an overview of our project (**FraudNow**), its components, and how to get started.

## Project Overview

Our project is a comprehensive solution for fraud detection in financial transactions. We have developed a web application with a user-friendly front-end and a robust back-end that incorporates machine learning for fraud detection. Here are the key components:

- **Frontend**:
  - Built with **Next.js** for a fast and responsive user interface.
  - State management is handled with **Redux** for efficient data flow.
  - We've used **Tailwind CSS** for a sleek and modern design.

- **Backend**:
  - Developed using **Spring Boot**, a powerful and scalable Java framework.
  - Data storage is managed using **MongoDB**, a NoSQL database, for flexibility and scalability.

- **Authentication**:
  - User authentication is handled by **Firebase Auth**, providing secure and easy-to-use authentication methods.

- **Machine Learning Model**:
  - Our project incorporates an AI model for **fraud detection**, enhancing the security of financial transactions.
  - The AI model is containerized using **Docker** for easy deployment and scalability.

## Getting Started

To get started with our project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm (for the front-end)
- Java and Spring Boot (for the back-end)
- MongoDB (for data storage)
- Firebase account (for authentication)
- Python and necessary libraries (for machine learning)
- Docker (for containerization)

### Setup

Follow the instructions in each repository to setup the project.

### Accessing the Application

Once everything is set up and running, you can access the application in your web browser. By default, it should be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Our application allows users to:

- Sign up and log in using Firebase Auth.
- Perform financial transactions securely.
- Benefit from AI-powered fraud detection.
- Visualize their transaction history.

Feel free to explore the various features and functionalities of our application to understand how we've implemented fraud detection and ensured secure financial transactions.
